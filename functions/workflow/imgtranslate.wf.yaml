#
# Simple workflow with two tasks: vision and translation.  A workflow
# is just a type of function.  The Vision task gets the workflow
# function's input and turns it into text.  The Translate task gets
# the Vision tasks output and translates it.  The workflow function
# returns the Translate task's output as its own output.

output: Translate  # The output of this workflow should be taken from
                   # the output of the Translate task below 
tasks:

  #
  # The vision task runs first because it has no dependencies on any
  # other task (not because it's first in this yaml file).
  #
  Vision:
    run: vision
    inputs: "{$.Invocation.Inputs.default}"

  # 
  # The translation task runs next.  It has two types of dependencies
  # on the Vision task: _control flow_ (what runs after what) and
  # _data flow_ (how does one task's output get to the other).
  #
  Translate:
    run: translation
    inputs: "{$.Tasks.Vision.Output}"    # Data flow
    requires: 
    - Vision                             # Control flow
